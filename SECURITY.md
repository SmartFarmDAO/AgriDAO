# Security Guidelines for AgriDAO

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for the AgriDAO platform development.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented in `index.html` with strict directives
- Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- Regular review and updates required as features are added

### 2. TypeScript Security Hardening
- Strict mode enabled across all configuration files
- No implicit any types allowed
- Unused variables and parameters detection enabled
- Strict null checks enforced

### 3. Input Validation Framework
- Zod-based validation schemas in `src/lib/security.ts`
- Sanitization functions for HTML content
- Rate limiting for client-side protection
- Secure local storage wrapper

### 4. Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: enabled
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Development Guidelines

### Input Validation
Always validate user inputs using the provided schemas:
```typescript
import { securitySchemas, validateInput } from "@/lib/security";

// Validate email input
const email = validateInput(securitySchemas.email, userInput);
```

### HTML Sanitization
Sanitize any user-generated content before display:
```typescript
import { sanitizeHtml } from "@/lib/security";

const safeContent = sanitizeHtml(userInput);
```

### Rate Limiting
Implement client-side rate limiting for sensitive operations:
```typescript
import { rateLimiter } from "@/lib/security";

if (!rateLimiter.isAllowed("login", 5, 60000)) {
  // Block action - too many attempts
}
```

### Secure Data Storage
Use the secure storage wrapper for sensitive data:
```typescript
import { secureStorage } from "@/lib/security";

secureStorage.set("userPreferences", preferences);
const data = secureStorage.get("userPreferences");
```

## Future Security Considerations

### Backend Security (When Implemented)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Validate all API inputs server-side
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure session management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Blockchain Security
- Smart contract audits before deployment
- Multi-signature wallets for fund management
- Proper access controls for DAO governance
- Regular monitoring of contract interactions

### Data Privacy
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Data minimization principles
- Secure data transmission
- Regular data backups with encryption

## Security Incident Response
1. Immediate containment of the issue
2. Assessment of impact and scope
3. User notification if required
4. Fix implementation and testing
5. Post-incident review and documentation

## Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Monthly dependency security audits
- [ ] Quarterly security code reviews
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Continuous monitoring of security advisories

## Reporting Security Issues
For security vulnerabilities, please contact the security team directly rather than creating public issues.
